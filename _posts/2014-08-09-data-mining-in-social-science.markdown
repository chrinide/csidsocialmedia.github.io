##Course Description

Data mining is a rapidly growing field in these years because of its ability to provide people powerful tools to extract meaningful information from a sea of data. However, harnessing the power of the data deluge could be challenging to social scientists because of its interdisciplinary nature.

This course covers the entire process of scientific data mining, including data collection, analysis, and visualization. The opportunity for hands-on Python programing practice on these tasks will be provided. The overall goal is to equip social science students with programming skills to complete research projects independently.

##Course Completion
Students are divided into small groups of 2-3 members and are required to complete small data mining projects based on their own research interest.

##Background Requirements
This course opens to both of undergraduate and graduated students. Students of zero programing background are welcomed.
