##Course Description


Data mining is a rapidly growing field in these years because of its ability to provide people powerful tools
to extract meaningful information from a sea of data. However, harnessing the power of the data deluge could
be challgenging to social scientists because of its interdisciplinary nature. 

This course will examine methods that have been proven to be useful in the study of human behaviors. The opportunity
for hands-on Python progaming practice on mining various types of data, including text, image, network, audio, and map, will be provided. The overall goal of this course is to equip students with skills to handle all kinds of available data that is relevant to thier reserach. 

Two versions of this course, introductory-level and advanced-level, are provided. The former is opened to undergraduate
students and the focus is the usage of existed Python modules, such as the [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) in text processing and the [NetworkX](https://networkx.github.io/) in network analysis. The latter is open to graduated students, who will learn to develope their own algorithms based on classical data mining methods, such as the Bayesian inference in text processing and the Page Rank Algorithm in network analysis.

##Course Competion 

Studnets are assigned to small groups of 4-5 members and resuqired to complete a data mining project based on their
own research interest.

##Background Requirements

Being curious about the unknown world (students of zero programing background are welcomed).
