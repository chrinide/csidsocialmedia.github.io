We are setting up a study group called "Programing Collective Intelligence". A major target of this group is to understand the algorithms behind the Web applications we are using everyday, such as recommendation systems on Amazon and anti-spam algorithms in Gmail. The best way to understand is to replicate. So we will do some Python programing. 

We will use [this book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529321.do) as a reference and publish some of our practices here. We meet every friday afternoon from 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm at [Ostrom Lab](https://csid.asu.edu/ostrom-lab/elinor-ostrom-multi-method-lab). The topics that we will go though are listed as follows:

+ 1. [Correcting spellings](http://csidsocialmedia.github.io/2014/03/28/Correcting-Spelling.html) (Mar. 28)
+ 2. [Recommending items](http://csidsocialmedia.github.io/2014/04/04/A-Recommedation-system-based-on-Yelp-data.html) (Apr. 04)
+ 3. [Discovering groups](http://csidsocialmedia.github.io/2014/04/10/Clustering-blogs-by-text.html) (Apr. 11)
+ 4. [Searching pages](http://csidsocialmedia.github.io/2014/04/18/Search-engine-in-nutshell.html) (Apr. 18)
+ 5. [Optimizing preferences](http://csidsocialmedia.github.io/2014/04/25/Finding-shortest-paths-on-flow-networks.html) (Apr. 25)
+ 6. [Predicting price](http://csidsocialmedia.github.io/2014/05/02/Predict-second-hand-car-price-using-artificial-neural-network.html) (May 02)
+ 7. [Measuring expertise](http://csidsocialmedia.github.io/2014/05/09/Measuring-the-difficulty-of-questions.html) (May 09)
+ 8. Modeling decisions (May 16)
+ 9. Predicting price (May 23)
+ 10. Evolving intelligence (May 30)

The current members of this group include

	+ Lingfei Wu (organizer, Lingfei Dot Wu At asu DOT edu, post-doc in CSID)
	+ Kehinde R Salau (post-doc in th Department of Mathematics, University of Arizona)
	+ Oyita Udiani (Applied Mathematics for the Life + Social Sciences, SHESC)
	+ Jordan Bates (the same as above)
	+ Komi Messan (the same as above)
	+ Daniel Burkow (the same as above)
	+ Diego Chowell (the same as above)
	+ Na Zhang (the same as above)
	+ Moon Zhang (Science in Business Analytics, W. P. Carey)
	+ Shan Yuan (the same as above)
	+ Linghuan zeng (the same as above)
	+ Jinxue Zhang (GCSE)

<sub>CSID stands for the Center for the Study of Institutional Diversity</sub>
<sub>SHESC stands for School of Human Evolution and Social Change</sub>
<sub>W. P. Carey stands for W. P. Carey School of Business</sub>
<sub>GCSC stands for Goldwater Center For Science and Engineering</sub>

During the meetings, we will divide into three or more groups, each one has their own project. Members are also encouraged to bring their own data mining/machine learning problems into discussions.  

Let's Rock!
