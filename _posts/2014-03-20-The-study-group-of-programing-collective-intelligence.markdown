We are setting up a study group called "Programing Collective Intelligence". A major target of this group is to understand the algorithms behind the Web applications we are using everyday, such as recommendation systems on Amazon and anti-spam algorithms in Gmail. The best way to understand is to replicate. So we will do some Python programing. 

We will use [this book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596529321.do) as a reference and publish some of our practices here. We meet every friday afternoon from 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm. The topics that we will go though are listed as follows:

	+ 1. Recommending items (Mar. 28)
	+ 2. Discovering groups (Apr. 04)
	+ 3. Searching pages (Apr. 11)
	+ 4. Optimizing preferences (Apr. 18)
	+ 5. Filtering documents (Apr. 25)
	+ 6. Modeling decisions (May 02)
	+ 7. Predicting price (May 09)
	+ 8. Evolving intelligence (May 16)

The current members of this group include


	+ Lingfei Wu (organizer, Lingfei Dot Wu At asu DOT edu)
	+ Jordan Bates
	+ Moon Zhang
	+ Oyita
	+ Komi Messan
	+ Kenny Salau
	+ Daniel Burkow


During the meetings, we will divide into two groups, each one has their own project. Members are also encouraged to bring their own data mining/machine learning problems into discussions.  

Let's Rock!
