###Why natural flow networks are so beautiful

The above figures visualize the U.S. river networks using [NHDPlus dataset](http://www.horizon-systems.com/nhdplus/) and [D3.js](http://www.somebits.com/rivers/rivers-d3.html). The amazing beauty of these natural flow systems motivates us to 
ask such questions: why they are so beautiful? Are there universal laws behind these systems, like the law of gravity ?
Or, is there a general "purpose" of these systems, like the principle of [least action](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_action) ?

[Rinaldo](http://www.image.unipd.it/a.rinaldo/allegati/Minimum_energy.pdf) (1992, 1993) et al. proposed a model called "optimal channel networks" (OCN) to explain the beutiful tree structure of flow networks. A comprehensive literature review on OCN can be found [here](http://abouthydrology.blogspot.com/2012/09/my-past-research-on-evolution-of-river.html). And [this](http://www.pnas.org/content/110/48/19295.abstract) and [this](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2014/01/31/1322700111) are two recently pulished papers on OCN.
