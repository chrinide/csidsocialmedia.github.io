Written in 1787, ratified in 1788, and in operation since 1789, the United States Constitution is the worldâ€™s longest surviving written charter of government [cite](http://www.senate.gov/civics/constitution_item/constitution.htm#amendments). There are 27 amendments to the Constitution . Approximately 11,539 measures have been proposed to amend the Constitution from 1789 through January 2, 2013. [cite](http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/three_column_table/measures_proposed_to_amend_constitution.htm)

We can download the full text of the US constitution and its 27 amendments from [here](http://www.usconstitution.net/const.txt) and conduct a simple analysis on its evolution.

###Who is more important ?  President, Congress, or Senate ?

The original version of the constitution has 4254 words. The word 'president' appreared for 32 times, more than 'congress' (27) and 'senate' (17). Even from the term frequencies we can infer the rank of importance as 

    + President > Congress > Senate
	

Use the onlne tool develped by [Jason Davies](https://www.jasondavies.com) we get the following word cloud.

This figure gives a very intuitive image of the importance rank.

###The stablility of the US constitution

Approximately 11,539 measures have been proposed to amend the Constitution in more than two hundred years (1789 ~ 2012), but we know that only 27 amendments were accepted [soruce](http://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/reference/three_column_table/measures_proposed_to_amend_constitution.htm). So the chance of a proposal to amend the consitution being accepted is 0.2%. Considering the dramatic change of our society in the past two hundred years, this incredibly low rate reflects that the consitution is very stable.
