##Barabasi-Albert model

In their 1999 Science [paper](http://www.barabasilab.com/pubs/CCNR-ALB_Publications/199910-15_Science-Emergence/199910-15_Science-Emergence.pdf), Barabasi and Albert proposed the network model of preferential attachment. To obtain the degree distribution, they first used "continuous-time mean-field analysis" to track the evolution of the degree of individual nodes and then derive the degree distribution. In subsequent work, Dorogovstev, Mendes and Samukhin ([2000](http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0004434)), took a different approach, using what they call the “master equation” to obtain rigorous asymptotics for the mean degree of the nodes. The lecture [note](http://economics.mit.edu/files/4624) of Daron Acemoglu and Asu Ozdaglar to explain this method inspired me a lot to analyse the dynamics of attention networks.
